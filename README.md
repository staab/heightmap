- Layers of resoultion x10
- Layer attributes - certain ones override, other ones merge. 
    - E.g., low resolution specifies area as wasteland, higher resolution specifies subset of area as swamp; it should be tundra-y swamp.
    - Eventually we'll want models placed on the map
- Figure out a better camera so it's easier to move around. Add basic collision detection to keep it above ground.
- Define biomes
    - Color related to elevation or features
    - Elevation characteristics
- Apply vectors of biomes with stroke width and jitter to build maps
